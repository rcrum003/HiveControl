--------------------
1.95 Release
--------------------

- If the LocalHive Updates Hivecontrol.org, we no longer clear the values in hivecontrol.org for things the local hive doesn't configure.

--------------------
1.83 Release
--------------------
1. Added support for the temper, minus the hum sensors.


--------------------
1.81 Release
--------------------
1. Changed diskspace output in systemstatus to show human readable format
2. Fixed an issue with Crontab not installing during install
3. Created an install image, since unix noobs couldn't figure out how to install without it.
	- Resizes hard disk on first install

--------------------
1.80 Release
--------------------
Wow, we did a lot of rework and found a few bugs in the process
1. You can now read the sensors on demand from the Instrument Config Admin
2. Fixed the Weight trend for the "Today" time period
3. Fixed when the WS1400 timed out
4. Fixed Ambient Temp Scripts to deal with errors when collecting data (such as WX offline, or the local sensor not working)
5. Fixed Currentconditions to show NA when it can't get a good reading
6. Changed the charts to end the line connecting points when mising data
7. Overhauled the scripts to output "null" instead of zero, showing better accuracy when we actually have a zero 
8. Simplified the currconditions.sh script by moving each set of sensor code into their own scripts, called by currconditions
9. Fixed the problem that if you disabled a sensor, it cleared all configuration entries (really sucked for the weight sensors, as it was hard to recalibrate a live hive)
10. Changed the upload to hivetool.org for the Ambient Weather - now uses XML instead of the key (key still needed) - but will reduce the amount of overages you get. Still best to get a key per hive.


--------------------
1.72 Release
--------------------
1. Changed Database table allhive to default to 0 if we don't get a value.
2. Fixed Tick Marks on main chart
3. Changed the way we start pigpiod - init.d wasn't working for us, for some reason and the author suggested adding to cron @reboot
4. Fixed systemadmin page "RemoveZero" humidity actually removed ALL data.


--------------------
1.70 Release Hotfix
--------------------
1. Added a service called pigpiod (needed so when reboots happen)

--------------------
1.69 Release Hotfix
--------------------
2. Fixed pressure_in check - we referenced the wrong value, thus invalidating the check itself, allowing "----" to be inserted into our DBs.

--------------------
1.68 Release Notes
--------------------
Major changes here. We were having stability problems with the wiringPI DHT code. We've switched to pigpio. 
1. New pigpio DHT based code, seems more stable and reliable that lol_dht/wiringPI based code. It was also causing a conflict when we were running our beecounter service.
2. New HX711 Python code, to leverage pigpio code base
3. Fixed page refresh after running calibration wizard to show new value on intstrument page 


--------------------
1.67 Release Notes
--------------------
1. Fixed today option to show full day and use local timezone.


--------------------
1.66 Release Notes

--------------------
1.63 Release Notes

2. Added a check for Locked file when running the DHT22 code
3. Removed the option to change running directory. (not needed)
4. Removed NASA ID, as that project seems dead.
5. Moved Weeather Instrument config to the Instruments page (for Nate)
6. Added option to specify IP address of your WS1400ip, if you are using (cuz Nate bought one)
7. Added SystemStatus option, because people liked that feature on Hivetool v1 code.

--------------------
1.62 Release Notes
--------------------
1. Implemented first version of Beecounter code, it's a large install.
	Going forward, it'll be an option included in the install.sh script
	The upgrade.sh won't install it automatically, you'll have to follow the instructions to get it setup.

--------------------
1.61 Release Notes
--------------------
1. Fixed unexpected error in currconditions.sh


--------------------
1.60 Release Notes
--------------------
1. Fixed a rare condition in that if you entered a decimal without a leading 0, HX711 would error out. We now check for that.
2. Added duplicate checking to database to disallow two hiveconfig rows with an ID of zero, just an added error check.
3. Added XRDP support during the install (you have to specify it though with -x if you want it) - Added for the folks who don't know how to enable it on their own.
4. Added TouchScreen Support for those that run the GUI Desktop, and can't install matchbox by themselves, use -k when installing to enable - example ./install.sh -k
5. Added the ability to "save on click" for all the forms, eliminating the save button. Fixes the problem of having to hit save to get the second set of options.
6. Changed Rain Trend to a Area Chart, instead of a bar.
7. Add rain to hive activity detail chart
8. Changed GDD Chart to be Area in Detail views
9. Added Pollen values to the GDD Detail chart
10. Fixed Current Conditions Metric Trend Calc error
11. Added field validation to hivebodyconfig.php


--------------------
1.59 Release Notes
--------------------

1. Disallow negative numbers in the check function in the main shell scripts. This protects if a instrument gives us a negative value.

3. Actually commited the check.inc file.


--------------------
1.58 Release Notes

2. Fixed All_charts flight color misspelling of variable.
3. Finished Weight Calibration Wizard feature for HX711 (the majority of our users)
4. Fixed a bug in DHT22.sh
5. Fixed getpollen script to use pollen.com, instead of Claritin
6. Fixed issue with Install script, it wasn't inserting the default values after install, causing improper startup.
7. Added "date/time to currentconditions.php so we know how current the data is (even though we have the option to show red, when the data is older than 5 minutes)."
8. Added 5 minute refresh of index.php, so we can watch our charts all day long!
9. Added check.inc function to check if we get an invalid figure for an expected value. Mainly for when the weather script returns pressure of ----
